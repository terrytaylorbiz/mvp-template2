[The **Reference** includes all the information users need to know to use your endpoints. That means you'll repeat the information below for each endpoint in your API.

Use this page if you prefer to create Markdown files for your reference. Here's what you'll need to do:
* Delete the OpenAPI reference example file `/_docs/openapi.md`
* Delete the code `<li {% if page.sectionid=='docs' %} class="active" {% endif %}><a href="{{ "/docs/openapi/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">OpenAPI</a></li>` from the file `/_includes/topnav.html`
* Delete the `- openapi` menu item from the file `/_data/docs.yml`]
